/*
 * Description: Using this sketch you can get your Arduino mac address through Serial Monitor.
 *              The mac address can be used for connection to the IoT-network.
 *              Prints the mac address every 5 seconds in the Serial Monitor.
 *              Serial speed: 9600
 * Author:  Mats Otten
 * Date:    8 sep 2021
 * Updated 22 oct 2024; changed the code to work with the ESP32.
 * Updated 26 sep 2025; changed to esp_wifi_get_mac()-function, which works with a larger amount of different esp32 boards.
